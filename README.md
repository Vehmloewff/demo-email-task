# Svelte Demo Emailer

A simple demo project built with SvelteKit and SendGrid.

## Local Development

Clone the project, then run...

```ssh
cat .env.example > .env
```

...then get an API key at SendGrid, and plug it in to `.env`.  After that, just...

```ssh
yarn dev
```

...and you should be good to go!
